CRM-1169740-M1G6,6090 air filter restriction switch logic review/change request.,"Ravensworth 6090 fleet have a history of engine cylinder head valve failures due to air filter restriction. Cummins report attached and air box design change instruction attached. Air boxes have been changed on all 3 Ravensworth 6090. Ravensworth have asked if further gains could be made if the air filter restriction alarm conditions were changed to de-rate the hydraulic power output similar to when high hydraulic oil temperature is active.
Question;
•	Is it possible within the operating programs for fault code 2890 and 3890 to have an implication to de-rate the hydraulics?

•	Changes in electrical schematics will need to show 3B21 and 4B21 as 25” H2O switch.
•	Changes in software Implication for 2890 and 3890 will need to latch the fault on the BCS screen to capture restriction spikes seen when intermittent higher loads occur as the filters start to plug.
•	The implication needs to De-rate the hydraulics.
•	2880 and 3880 can be left as OEM settings to alarm at 20” H2O with no implications other than fault on BCS as current.

CRM-1336299-P7F9,CW34 - C34 & BL7 - Steering Pin Failures,"A growing number of steering pin failures on CW34 machines with C34 and B7L serial prefixes in dealer territory is documented by this DPPM entry.  There are 5 confirmed failures to date, all occurring in under 4000 hours service.  The pin in question connects the steering cylinder rod eye bearing to the left hand suspension cylinder and linkage.  The failure mode is fatigue crack development causing the pin to shear catastrophically at the base of the pin beneath the cylinder rod eye bearing where the pin is welded to the structure.  The DSN tickets that are associated to this SR contain further details.  We have noticed in 2 cases where the bolt holes inside the pin have been drilled too deep at manufacture, and the bolt holes are evident in the shear plane on failed pins.

The failure causes loss of steering control of the machine and therefore is considered to be a safety issue. While no incidents have occurred as a consequence so far, it seems only a matter of time before a failure will cause a collision with another machine or person.  The failure effectively renders the machine immobile until it can be towed or repaired, and since these machines are a critical piece of equipment working in conjunction with other machines on road projects, great inconvenience is caused to the customer by the failure.

The pin is welded to the suspension structure, and it's a part that is non-serviceable, requiring the dealer or customer to implement a field solution to reattach the steering cylinder and move the machine.  Even if the root cause of these failures is the bolt holes drilled too deep, the pin design should be reviewed to determine whether the pin should be a removeable and serviceable component, similar to a ball stud, so that in-service inspection and replacement after failure or damage is more readily accomplished in the field.  Damage to the pin is reasonably conceivable if the machine steer tyres collide with a solid object, so the pin should be a serviceable part.  The current pin design doesn't facilitate in service NDT to detect internal cracking before failure.",,Dealer Open,Work In Progress,470124,"Redmond, Patrick","Ibrahim, Bassem",Earth Move,PNEUMATIC COMPACTORS,6,2000,528,Awaiting failed parts return and analysis.,,,,,4/16/2020 4:45,4/16/2020 5:55,5/1/2020 4:46,,T030,HASTINGS DEERING (AUSTRALIA) LTD.,T030,,4451269

Publication states- ""In the event of failure, create a PSCRM Product Health SR (service request) through your Dealer Technical Communicator (TC) for troubleshooting/guidance procedure"".
Attached PSR",,Dealer Open,Work In Progress,451695,"Brown, Jim A","Sharpnack, William S",BCP,COMPACT WHEEL LOADERS,1,0,,"04.28.20 Our Engineering Performance Engineers are currently working with our software supplier to create a new flash file for this un-commanded motion detected issue. They are telling me that it should be released end of this quarter but with this virus that may be delayed a bit.  But until then there are a few things we can tell the customer. 
 
1.For the most part, we think this primarily happens with hystat aggressiveness mode in high (3 lights). Advise the customer to run the lower hystat aggressiveness mode (one or two lights on the optional 8 button keypad) and to apply the park brake when on a hill (If machine rolls the fault can trip and force the machine into neutral).  If your machine does not have an optional 8 button keypad, you can go into ET and change the configuration in the low range but not in high range.  High range will stay at medium.  
- We think that with the most aggressive mode set, you can step on the pedal and let up before the machine moves, but as the engine takes a while to slow down due to flywheel inertia, the machine still has time with engine speed and moves forward, but it does so after you have released the pedal so the machine is moving with you not pressing the pedal and you get the code which typically causes machine to go into neutral. A more smooth operation of the throttle pedal should improve this. Machine typically will go into neutral and you will have to cycle the key. The new software will be less sensitive. 
 
2. The bucket is operated stationary and the machine rocks back and forth accumulating a ""fake"" distance traveled which is tripping the code.  
 
3. Currently the software needs to see movement with less than 10% throttle, we are going to change that to less than 5% throttle.
 
If the customer’s machine is getting forced into neutral and a key cycle is required to get it running again, recalibrating the hystat pump may improve this as well.  As the pump will have now be bedded in, the cal currents will be a little high and therefore you can get movement with less throttle.
Re calibrating the hystat pump will help increase the throttle pedal position to get to start to move.  The other thing I’d recommend trying is to turn the creeper dial down slightly so it takes more throttle pedal depression before the machine starts to move, this will however limit the machine max capability at full throttle.
For machines without the optional keypad, in ET you need to have the machine in low gear range and then you can set the hystat mode to the low setting but remember, it will only stay in the lower setting when the machine is in the low gear ranges not high. Once you stop the machine and shift into high range the machine will go to “intermediate” setting.
We are hoping to have new software in a few months to address this but in the meantime it can be minimized by following these steps.

CRM-1293087-Z7R3,326 JYM Grade Accuracy,"Hello, 
We are having an issue with Grade Control. 
After techs did bucket measure up and did accuracy check, it was not even close. If you have the bucket curled out and set a bench mark, then curl half way and reset the bucket on the bench mark it shows about 18"" above grade. I suspected that we might have an IMU that needed to be re calibrated so I assisted them with this. After doing IMU identification and body IMU we stretched the boom and stick all the way out. Our value for the boom IMU was +3.1 and the stick IMU was -31.2. 
Then we measured up the bucket again and I came up with numbers really close to what they had, We then did an accuracy test and once again after setting a bench mark when changing the bucket/stick angle it would show above grade. More as you curled the bucket in. 
I don't know if we possibly have a bad IMU or there is possibly an incorrect measurement of boom/stick dimension?
Machine is equipped with 5272203 Reach Boom and 5272207 Stick. I looked through medias and didn't find any dimensions on these like the 320-330 listed in M0082996

This has been noted on a number of repairs and is considered fairly common to see with a little as a couple rollers to free up or in some cases force is require to free up a number of rollers.

Potential slight loss in performance when LUC is engaged and/or fuel efficiency. The free wheel stator feature on certain M-series MWL and D-series WSK sometimes seizes up and fails to function. This does not impede operation of the machine but may result in a slight loss of performance and/or increase in fuel consumption.

Technician notes:
Machine has been rebuilt by another shop, ECM code 6-5, cylinder #6 injector: current below normal has been intermittently logging since. Before we got involved Injectors have been swapped out, engine main harness has been changed and injector harness was changed previously by shop who rebuilt. Customer wanted ECM replaced but did not change code from logging. Went to job site and could not duplicate code until machine was hot after a few hours of use. Code would flash on and off until cooled down for a few minutes. Wiggle tested main harness and injector harness but could not get code to come back. We found incorrect injector harness was installed previously, Replaced injector harness and code did not reappear for 3 weeks. Code reappeared and checked over again, Pin fitment and pins all ok, grounds ok, jumped injector and code would change to current above normal.

The plan was to perform a change in revision level to the part but that plan was eventually overridden at higher levels and we were informed to launch a CPI project and create a new part number.  When we started running failure data to get the CPI launched we were finding very low numbers for the overall machine population using this part.  I tried looking at specific machines but still could not get enough failures to launch the project.  I have repair ends I can send in the interim but I need to get failures documented and keep checking to see when our failures are high enough to launch a project.
Thank you,

4/30/2019 We have asked Caterpillar Tier II Neil Hess when a PCA harness will be in production. No firm date yet.
ICA: Use harness replacement end 132-6469. The pig tail is longer and can be tied to the main part of the harness to protect vibration and the wire failure. we have had the same failure mode the six strand brittle wire failure at the crimp multiple times also. The whole harness needs a redesign but the 132-6469 the best ICA at this time. I would recommend replacing all 6 ends and tie back to the main harness to prevent vibration at the crimp. Oil resistant heat shrink tube PN# 125-7874 material needed for 132-6469 to make the connection complete.   

1/31/2019 Neil Hess spoke the manager for the harness design group. They are in process of updating the design for the harness to keep it moving through processes for production. They are not waiting on CPI project to fix the harness. We will be closing this DPPM once we have a timeline on when the change will be being made. Harness end 132-6469 can be used as an ICA replacement end.

Specifically, we would like to increase the size of the radius in areas K4 and K5 (the inside corners of the steering arm mounting faces).  Our reasoning is:
 - The majority of the salvage repairs we must make to the spindles are to grind out cracks in areas K4 and K5. Cracks in that area are also the cause of nearly half of our replacements. 
 - The existing salvage guideline allows grinding to a depth of up to 5 mm without welding it back up.
 - If we remove material only from the bottom face, we don't compromise the piloting face, and it's much easier to machine (see attached drawing).

Note, the details and exact dimensions in the attached drawing are all up for review, the drawing is only meant to communicate the concept.

The Chassis ECM logged diagnostic codes 248-9 CAT DATA link not communicating and 800-9 VIMS Main Module: Abnormal update rate.
The Product Link technician was sent to investigate. When ET was connected to the machine, the PL601 controller did not show up on the list of ECM’s. 
The power supply, ground and wiring of the connector on the module was inspected and no defects were found.
The conclusion was that the controller was faulty. A REMAN 20R-6220 PL601 control was ordered.
While waiting for the replacement part to arrive, the decision was made to swap the PL601 controller with another 777E KDP00342 which was still in the assembly process. The PL601 controller from KDP00342 was installed into KDP00319, and the controller was working in KDP00319. The machine was sent back to production no further problems was reported by the customer regarding KDP00319.
The REMAN PL601 arrived and was installed the 18th of August 2017 on KDP00342, to replace the working PL601 control which was removed to be installed in KDP00319.
After installation, it was found that the controller did not communicate. After testing it was determined that the controller was faulty.
A new PL601 control 459-0786 was ordered. After installation it had the same problem, not communicating. All wiring to the controller was checked again and it was determined that the controller was faulty. 
Another new PL601 459-0786 was ordered and installed the 4th of September 2017. The controller was again found to faulty – out of box failure.
A new PL601 459-0786 controller was ordered for replacement on KDP00342.
The part number of the PL601 459-0786 was checked on SIMSi and DPPS to determine what could be the cause of the PL601 controller failures. CPI 374840 and TIB M0065343 was found regarding the controller failures. A total of 1071 SIMS records was logged against the PL601 459-0786 controller. 
The four failed controllers was checked for the two problems as listed in the TIB, but the controller does not show up on the ECM list on ET and does not communicate, even when installed on another machine (966L MWL FRS serial prefix), which have the same PL601 controller installed and is known to be working.

CRM-757792-W6Y3,301.5 - LJH02643 - Whilst Tramming joysticks wobble causing pilot oil drop and thus tramming circuit in and out of high/low speeds causing machine inconstancy in tramming speeds.,"Customer has reported that this machine (along with others of the same model) has inconsistent tramming speeds.  This is mainly evident when the machine is tramming in high speed across harder surface areas. Many tests were carried out and it was found that when this problem occurred the cabin joysticks were wobbling around causing the joystick plungers that operate the pilot circuits,  were in fact been pushed downwards by the wobbling joysticks causing a pressure differential of the pilot circuit. And in turn unintentionally causing a function to be activated (in this case the boom down)  taking pilot oil away from the high/low pilot function.

History.
A DSN # CRM-271367-M4P9 was created in January 20, 2016.  After many back and forth correspondences it was advised from CAT that whilst the dealer had found the root cause of this issue that fitting stronger springs than designed wasn't endorsed by Caterpillar.  WHY?  Caterpillar don't endorse this modification due to the legal agreements between CAT and Whacker Nelson.

NOTE:  At this stage there was many checks carried out both by Westrac WA and NSW branches however the issue still remained once the machines were operated on harder surfaces.  Some of these checks carried out were as follows.  
 - Different configuration of rubber tracks.
 - Operator holding onto the joysticks whilst tramming - Issue disappears.
 - Westrac WA tried fitment of stronger springs as a once off trial.  Issue disappears.

The DSN was closed August 2017.  
RESOLUTION as follows:  We were able to duplicate this issue with a machine at our UK facility. So, the engineers in Europe can now visit that machine to work on this issue. Still the engineering facility is on holiday until mid August so late August is the earliest time that we could get any new information. See CPI Number:  376002.

October 2017 this issue was raised in conjunction with Westrac WA Marketing team as unresolved and thus the justification to add this issue into the PPM.

As we stand 07/12/17 - Sandeep Ohri (Caterpillar Service Technical Representative) is in discussion with Caterpillar US whom are in further discussions with Whacker Nelson on this subject.  Whacker have indicated there was a change to the spring development and possibly we have an older spring fitment.  So in the meantime Westrac have ordered (as instructed by Caterpillar) to change out the complete priority valve bank out for new.  And trial the machine from here to report back through Nick back to CAT the findings.  This valve part #  4876032 is due at the dealer around the 20th December 2017.

Does Caterpillar have a solution to get more amps out of the alternator 397-9953  when the machine is at idle for extended periods of time as this is the way the machine is operated?

Technician Notes:
Customer has three 908M - H88 prefix.  Customer safety standard requires the machine to have brushless alternators.  The machine are equipped with brushless alternators.  The problem is that the brushless alternator when at low idle doe not produce enough charge to the battery and customer is draining the batteries and need to replace the batteries itself.

As the original bearing bore has 6” of diameter and the new bearing bore has 6.5” of diameter, there is a considerable gap of 12.7mm (0.5”) which could justify an intermediate option. Is there this option, or is it feasible to have it (for example, a bearing bore of 6.25”)?

In addition, LMTs have a sleeve available to repair the bore as per SMag M0067368, which allows the A-frame to continue receiving the original Spherical Bearing 6V-0444. If 775F/G A-frame needs to be salvaged, it demands a bearing and nut that are different from the original ones and it is mandatory to remove the A-frame and bring it to dealership to be salvaged because of the insufficient space on the machine and lack of appropriate tooling at the field. All these difficulties in 775 could be mitigated if the repair method (procedure and parts) was similar to LMTs. This is the preferable improvement as it will provide a much easier maintenance with no need to remove the A-frame during bore repair.

CRM-904919-K6X9,Hydraulic cylinder seal failure due to bauxite dust bypassing cylinder seals,"Unsatisfactory hydraulic cylinder seal life in machines operating in bauxite mining applications in Weipa region.  The dealership has reported via DSN numerous cases of early hour hydraulic cylinder seal failures on machines operating in Bauxite mine applications in the Weipa region.  The earliest hour failure was 67 hours from new.  The recent failures on LWX00780 and 781 occurred around 1000 hours from new, but most failures that are occurring would be classified as early hour or reliability downtime events.  Refer attached associated SR's for previous DSN submissions from Hastings Deering. The DSN submissions have resulted in no CPI projects or other improvement actions being implemented by Caterpillar. 

The problem affects hydraulic cylinders on machines to varying degrees, mostly large wheel loaders due to extensive presence at the affected sites, but issues also seen with LTTT.  Affected components are primarily lift & tilt cyls on the loaders and blade lift & blade tilt on the track type tractors.  Refer to attachment ""Copy of 993K and D11T Hydraulic Cylinder Original Life.XLS"" showing a number of affected machines cylinder changeouts and component hours.  Row 73 on the spreadsheet shows D11T AMA00160 has had 13 left side blade lift cylinders and 10 right side blade lift cylinders, 7 right blade tilt cylinders, 5 left blade tilt cylinders, [at the time the spreadsheet was last updated in 03 Feb 2016].  To any other customer this number of cylinder reseal repairs would be totally unacceptable.

The dealer TC does not understand why the problem appears to have become more prevalent in the last few years. Bauxite mining in Weipa has been continuous since 1963, with production rates reasonably consistent year to year, and in recent years exceeding 20 million tons annually.  No information is available to Dealer TC whether there is a parts quality or incompatibility issue contributing to the problem in this application: updates to rods and seal parts, supplier or source facility change, or manufacturing process changes to the parts that have reduced component service life in this particular application only. There's no CPI's that seem relevant. 

The seal failures also contribute to hydraulic system contamination from dirt entry.  

Customer has trialled the use of gaiters to protect the exposed part of the rods, but this has not been successful.  Other ICA's have included trials using aftermarket Chesterton seals combined with treating repaired rods with a Micro Tuff polymer coating which promises some improvement in cylinder life, but not a total solution.  Refer attachment 'Copy of RTA Cylinder Modifications.xlsx'.  As reported in the associated DSN #CRM-288217-L0X9, failed Caterpillar cylinder seals from some 993K loaders, plus one 992G, were returned to the factory via several SIB's (SIB1139873 / 876 / 883 / 885 & 887) in July 2015.

Rio Tinto operates around 80 Caterpillar machines in the Weipa region, and is the major customer affected.  There are also a number of smaller customers and plant hire customers experiencing the problem.  Although the problem seems to be confined to this particular region and application, Rio Tinto is a major global customer, so product issues that attract adverse attention may influence future machine purchase decisions at this site, and elsewhere in their operations.  

Dealer TC believes if the seal life in this application is below what would be considered 'reasonable', an application-specific solution should be a worthwhile improvement action.  If this can't be done, machine customers could be appropriately advised of these application limitations prior to machine sale.  From the dealer's perspective, there would seem to be sufficient numbers of affected product and commercial risk exposure to justify a CPI project to develop an application-specific solution for this problem.

This has destroyed the second section of boom and has worn down the anchor weldment in the base section.

In addition to the all which you should see in the pics, when the boom is stretched out it allows the telescope cylinder rod to bend an extreme amount which I would just about imagine has damaged the cylinder barrel and created metal in our hyd system.

2.	Al bronze.
When sharing this with Kit Passwater in lower power train he provided the following back.

I would say it looked line manufacturing related.  If it was coming from something wearing or from parts being machine, it would have the same material make up.   The only difference would be its appearance or how it was cut/ground to be generated/produced --which I don't think they made  any reference to what they though was the source of the chips.

Let me know your thoughts as I think it still aligns with what Kit originally suspected about it being manufacturing related.

When I arrived at the machine the first thing I did was to check the drain tubes for blockage. Neither of the tubes have a valve in them and are clear of any debris. I ran the machine and checked pressures too see if the evaporator could be freezing over and thawing. The pressures for the A/C system are good. I found that there was not much water coming out of the hoses. I removed the access panels on the sides of the A/C unit and removed the hoses then pulled out the drain fittings. When I removed the drain fittings water began running out. There are no blockages that I can find. I asked the foreman if the operator ever runs the machine with the doors or windows open which could cause a lot of condensation to build up. He said the operator always keeps the cab closed and the cab is clean. I checked through SIS and could find no valves for the drain lines like most systems have.

The root cause of the failures is the rear PTO drive idler gear retainer bolts loosening.   The affected bolt part number is 189-6123, 4 bolts are used in each idler gear retainer [part number 209-9770] that support a rear PTO drive - two PTO drives can be installed.  The affected group number for the rear gear train is 380-2917.  When the idler gear retainer bolts become loose, gear train failure occurs which can also cause resultant damage to flywheel housing and an out-of machine repair & consequential downtime. 

Since the failures are generally occur at less than 1000 engine hours, we believe the problem stems from the bolts not being torqued properly at the reman engine facility.

Dealer troubleshooting confirms the coolant and oil temperature sensors in each case are undamaged, and sensor outputs are valid.  When the 391-8330 harness wiring to these sensors is bypassed with temporary wiring, the fault doesn’t return.  In one case the bypass wiring was left in place for 2 months with no further fault recorded.  The following engines had the harnesses replaced during the overhaul:

BEN00397    Installed @ 45,577 Hrs ,  Replaced @ 46,733 Hrs     = 1,156 Hrs
BEN00399    Installed @ 48,202 Hrs ,  Replaced @ 54,178 Hrs     = 5,976 Hrs
BEN00412    Installed @ 52,195 Hrs ,  Replaced @ 53,953 Hrs     = 1,758 Hrs
BEN00461    Installed @ 47,925 Hrs ,  Replaced @ 48,896 Hrs     =     971 Hrs 

The service hours on the harness in the above 4 cases may be higher than the actual hours at failure, as the failure hours recorded would be when the part was able to be replaced.  SIMSi entries have been made for each failure.  The affected units listed in this ticket also include BEN01162 and BEN01196 where the fault occurred even though the harness was factory installed.  In the case of BEN01196 there have been two failures - see affected unit section. 

The dealership previously reported the harness failures on DSN service request CRM-658424-W8R5, and trend data and product status reports were attached to that ticket.  However the dealer questions were not answered and the ticket was closed.  For this submission, dealer TC found no CPI's in dealer view, and no other DSN tickets or DPPM tickets were found in a DPSS search.  The dealership have a number of competitors for service work on G3600 product, and the parts department have sold the harness to a number of customers, so the scale of the problem may be bigger than what we are reporting here.

And this cause a big concern to our customer as they are being afraid that the similar failures could occurred on the remaining 06 halves of the axles on the two machines in coming time. Customer is urging aggressively a permanent resolution for the current failures, the progressive solution to prevent similar failure in future. We checked in CAT system and found that, the failure mode was analyzed in CPI#: 407475, 924K, 926M, 930K/M BRAKE GP-PLNTY&-Gp, GEAR-SUN, BROKEN in which the root cause was determined as Step was created during finish grinding, likely by grinding past the protuberance… Sun Gear Shaft part numbers 253-8919 and 254-3963 manufactured by PF supplier AA Gear showed a visual geometry issue. Gear tooth root geometry from the hob cutter did not meet 1E0590 specification and a step was created during the finish grinding process. Engineering gear analysis indicated a 25 - 30% increase in bending stress, which yields unacceptable service life. 

And the permanent resolution were PI32878 and Service Magazine M0089869. Unfortunately, the PIP PI32878 did not cover two customer machines KW401230 and KW401228

Because the high cost of repair (about 10000 USD including parts, labor and misc) for one side failed axle and great concern from customer, could you pls help us include two machines into the PIP PI32878 so that we could have a proactive solution, replacing the causing parts before failure for the remaining axles of the two machine?

CRM-1013667-Y4W4,Swing motor failure,"Swing motor on the machine failed. And in our analysis, this failure of swing motor was the result of swing gear box failure before and further, the splines joint between swing motor and swing gear box which damaged due to shortage of oil lubrication from factory. The swing gear box failure could also be due to improper oil level filled from factory. The LHS swing gear box broken first, and the Metal contamination showed up on BCS the day before gearbox failure and the day of failure. Then soon as machine was back in operation after installed. The 4th and 5th November the codes self-cleared. But from the 9th we had to clean the sensor each time. I think that swing gear box broken and caused severe damage to splines and would resulted in damage of swing motor bearings and then damaged other components of the motor as seen.

The pump then was removed and brought back to our work shop, then was disassembled by our tech as it found one bronze bushing of the pump barrel was come out and broken, one another bushing had evidence of coming out. Pls see Service Report attached for detail. 

This failure mode of the pump was right to description in PS53623, but we did not know why this machine serial number was not included in the Service Letter PS53623. The Service Letter listed serial numbers in range from GJA10001 to 10006, but we think from the failure on this machine GJA10009, this range had not included all possible affect serial number, including at least GJA10009.

At the moment, customer is very unhappy for this early failure of important component, main hydraulic pump. Customer purchased two 336D, out of this one, the remaining is GJA10011 and customer is worrying that the similar failure of main hydraulic pump would occur on the their second 336D. And in our opinion, this worrying from customer is understandable and the similar failure is quite possible.

From the above description and observation, we think that the ultimate solution for the failure of main hydraulic pump on this mahcine should be applying Service Letter PS53623 for this machine.

We would like also, CAT engineer include both two customer 336D serial numbers: GJA10009 and GJA10011 in the service letter.

The problem could not be fixed with resealing of the outside seal. At the beginning, In our observation, color of the grease filled from factory and leaked was different with color of grease recommended in OMM. After changing the grease as recommended in OMM, the problem was fixed for a time and then grease leaked again and this repeated many times already and was not solved so far. Could you pls see the leakage in service reports attached and then help us determine if the leakage was at outside seal or inner seal of the swing gear bearing? Pls note, we followed strictly CAT procedure of installation of a new seal, but it still leak again.

Chad with heavy equipment went out to look at it, thought the starter relay was stuck so he put a new starter on it. Same result. He removed the new starter and installed the original starter on it. He then ordered an engine ecm for the machine. I got the engine ecm and a new ignition switch for the machine and went to it. When I got there, I verified that when the battery disconnect is turned to the on position the engine turns over for a brief time. When inside the cab of the machine, and the key is turned to the on position, not the start position,  the machine turns over until turned off. Went underneath machine and disconnected starter relay. Got back into the machine and turned the machine to the on position, hooked up com adapter and ran ET to read modules and copy the engine ecm data. ET would not connect to machine. Removed key switch and installed new key switch. Plugged in starter relay, turned new key switch to the on position,  machine began to crank. Removed new key switch and installed original switch. Using another computer and com adapter, ran ET again. ET would only communicate with 2 of the 6 modules on the machine. Unplugged engine ecm, machine would not turn over. Installed new engine ecm, machine would begin to crank with the key in the on position or when turning the battery disconnect on.  Removed new ecm, installed original ecm. Ordered machine ecm. Removed old machine ecm, installed new ecm. Machine still cranks with key on or with battery disconnect turned to the on position. ET would not communicate with all controllers. Checked voltage at the starter. With the key switch in the on position,  the starter was recieving 19v. In the crank position  the starter was receiving 24v. With the key in the on position,  performed wiggle test of the cab harness. Starter would lose voltage with the key in the on position while moving cab wiring harness. Ordered new cab wiring harness. Installed new cab wiring harness, same results. And then Wednesday we went through all the steps of removing and unpinning wires and checking voltages and we came to the conclusion of the engine ecm again. I installed a new engine ecm, results are the same. On this machine, the main machine wiring harness was replaced a month ago due to a leaking DEF injector, parts we have tried to correct this issue are a key switch, cab harness, machine ecm, engine ecm and a starter.

Note: When we installed both engine ECM's they we not programmed. After the ECM was installed the machine was trying to start as soon as the main disconnect was turned on.

We unplugged the 120 pin connector 10 on the back side of the cab and the engine did not try to start. With the 120 pin connector 10 still disconnected we jumped only 1 wire (130 RD pin 11 power wire that splits and powers the ECM all the time) from the connector to the cab. The engine tried to start with only that wire powered. We checked the input from the engine will it is trying to start and found no power on the ignition wire, and start signal.

CRM-1052652-W4R1,745/3T6/Differential Failures,"This machine belongs to Charah and is one of 3 center differential failures at this one location. The first was 3T600530 back in 10/18 that was attributed to the differential thrust ring dowels failing. However, now that we have had two failures back to back (3T600513 and 3T600521) we are beginning to believe that the broken dowels that we found in the housing are a symptom, not the cause of the issue. 

The dowels have rubbed into the differential housing, but it is only in one area of the circumference suggesting that they were only able to make contact with the housing once the smaller bearing began to fail and dropped. 

I've also attached pictures of 3T600521 that also include pictures as the differential was being disassembled. These pictures also show how the 108-8369 adjustment ring has been tightened during operation and indexed past the locking tab, bending it in the process.

Ray is working with the customer now and will explain the situation and why we want to conduct this swap now, and he anticipates this should be done in the next 2 or 3 weeks.

The following serial numbers are the machines that the complaints are associated with: WTE00125, WTE00130, WTE00132 & WTE00135.  I have taken a PSR from each of these machines.  WTE00130 has the most logged events.  According to the operators, all of them are consistently generating the warning about changing operation due to high hydraulic oil temperature.  It appears that some operators stop operation and let the machine cool and others are waiting until the alarm comes on.  This is reflected in the attached PSR's.  WTE00130 has 19 logged E878 events in the last 48 operating hours.  I took a data log of this machine today and observed 183 degrees hydraulic oil temperature with a recorded ambient of 79.3.  The data log is attached.  Please refer to the attached diagnostic information for three of these machines.  After looking into them, it seems like the systems are operating as designed.  It appears to me that due to the duration that the hydraulic system is operated in the WW configuration that the hydraulic oil cooling system may not be capable of effectively managing the heat generated.  I noticed in the price pages that a lane 1 order has a ""373-8523 COOLING, HIGH AMBIENT TIER 4"" group available.

I'm seeing no other failures like this in DPSS,  Can CAT please Advise if CAT have seen similar.   There has been previous DSN Tickets regarding Wiper Seal Dimensions from WesTrac also.

At the moment,  I have asked site for :- 
*  Dimensions of the New Wiper Seal to be checked and the Rod Dimensions to be checked.
* Photos of the Damaged Deal
* Strip Reports of Previous Cylinder Failures

What i'd Like to Ask CAT for :-

The failure occurred after only 995 hours of blower operation - please refer to the attached Filed Service Report.

Attached please find an image of the original design Hoist Blower Intake Screen, which has been working relatively problem free for decades - or at least Finning ( Canada ) has not received reports of early hours failure of the previous ( original ) design.

Installation of the new design Intake Screen poses a great risk, as metal shrapnel from the screen will result in imminent Hoist Motor failure if aspirated by the Blower Fan.
The above scenario may also result in potential IGBT Module(s) failure in the Hoist Inverter, if the Hoist Motor damage from metal fragments of the screen,results in phase to phase short circuit condition.

Attached are also earlier reports from other customer sites, indicating that the new design Hoist Blower Intake screen fails in similar fashion.

The subject part has been recently identified in Parts Tech Ticket CRM-1042329-S9P9 as 461-4604.

DSN ticket CRM-1048809-N4K4 has been generated on the subject, and CPI project has been requested.

CRM-615632-J0B7,Master link failure D10 and D11 - all model series with single tooth master link.,"D10 and D11 undercarriage, single tooth master link early failure in field-assembled master links in coal application.  Failure mode: master bolts loosening and bolted joint failure causing track separation while machine is in operation.  Machine recovery to perform a track repair can be difficult if the track separation occurs while the machine is on a coal stockpile or other sloping/unstable location.  Machine recovery under these circumstances causes a lot of customer concern, as it places recovery personnel into a high risk activity.  Most failures have occurred on customer-assembled tracks, but also with dealer-witnessed track assemblies at customer sites.  Early failures have reportedly occurred within 50 hours to 2000 hour timeframes.  Factory assembled master joints appear to be less affected by this problem. 

Certain customers have had repeated early-hour failures, and as a consequence have low confidence in the durability of the single tooth master link design when compared to the former 5 tooth master link joint.  A number of customers have decided to procure aftermarket tracks [ITR] with 5 tooth master links, so this customer response reduces the dealer's ability to maintain undercarriage sales, and reduces customer overall satisfaction with the machine.  Customers were very satisfied with the previous 5 tooth design.

This issue has been thus far officially reported by Mount Milligan Mine  ( Shovel S01 S/N 141473 & Shovel S02 S/N 141474 ), as well as Suncor ( Shovel 1506 S/N 141325 ).

Attached please find field reports pertaining to the subject machines. A DSN ticket CRM-550911-G7G7 has also been generated, to document the latest incident involving MTM's S-01 ( S/N 141473 ).

The event of PLC stopping has also been a subject of CPI 281353.

The Caterpillar ICA, offered to MTM Mine some time ago, involved PLC Rack Card Brace, which basically sandwiched all of the NODE1 Cards, however did not secure the cards to the backplane. 

At this point, it is believed that the jarring and vibration of the shovel has detrimental effects on Rack 1 Backplane, and the resolution would involve application of "" Card Brace "" which would involve sandwiching the cards, as well as securing thus created card assembly to the PLC Backplane.

During attempts to identify the root cause of Lube Fault CDA395 ( A2 Lube Circuit Fault ), the customer has observed that the fault is occurring when switching the machine from Dig mode to Propel mode, but only if the A2 pump is already running at the time.

This scenario suggest that there may be a software error, resulting in overall air pressure / lube pressure drop when lube pump sequence is not prioritized.
The customer has turned the Dig Mode Timer up to 20 minutes, to limit the chances of this occurrence, but apparently the problem still does exist. 

Review of A2 Lube System Software, and possibly simulation of the above noted scenario is requested.

Inadequate lubrication of the A2 Propel System will result in premature component wear and consequential failure.

The train of correspondence on the subject is attached for reference.

This has not been previously reported by the customer due to low cost of the replacement component and busy work load, however with the large quantity of parts used, it became a point of concern.

This is a new issue and information surrounding the failures is being gathered, and the site has been requested to provide couple of the failed components for analysis.

At this point, it is suspected that high level of harmonic distortions in the mine power grid may be to blame.

Because this is part of the steering system it is critical the pump is set up and operating correctly. Today the only information in SIS to set or adjust the steering compensator is for the high pressure cut out... nothing for the low pressure standby or current adjustment screw . There is service magazine M0077525 for making pre-adjustments when installing a new 215-6758 pump control valve. Measurements from the old compensator are needed for the pre-adjustments. SM has a note after step 2 NOTE: make adjustments before operating the machine. Step 3 proceed to bench testing or testing and adjusting procedures for final compensator adjustments. However bench testing is not a viable option and there is no in chassis final compensator adjustment available to the field.  Dealer has pulled the 2016-2018 parts sales history on the 215-6758 from three of our Oil Sands Sites and have 83 sales, note the same 215-6758 is also used with the fan motor, however there are limited reports that compensator replacement on the fan pumps are taking place. Dealer is aware of Service Magazine M0084089-02 on improved compensator 527-6907 replacing former 2156758.

Initially there was the diagnostic code E3821-5 active. Followed the troubleshooting (UENR0668-29) and finally suspected it could be an electric problem with the DEF injector. Then eplaced it, but the code remained active. Checked again the wires and jumped them from the DCU to the DEF Injector, unsuccessfully. Reflashed then the Engine and DCU ECMs, but then codes E3821-5 and E3821-6 were still there. Finally replaced the ECM. Then was only the code E3821-5 active, but no clue why. 

Having in mind that the troubleshooing UENR0668-29 have also included the steps for diagnostic codes 3126-5 and -6 (related with the diverter valve), performed the override to the diverter valve, and that was the solution. The code E3821-5 (DEF injector) gone and up to now it has never appeared again.

CRM-812447-Y3S4,966L -Serial number FRS01307.Machine  dont want to move  forward or backwards.,"Good day all. Wheel 966L -Machine  don't want to move  forward or backwards. 

On the 9th February 2018 Operator reported to the mine supervisor that the machine don’t want move forward and backwards when he selecting the shift gears. Field service artisan was called in to the site for a troubleshooting. 
 
During troubleshoot artisan found that machine had an error code 672-08 on a 966L, which indicate that there is a faults in the speed sensor. Field service technician contacted a test on torque convertor speed sensor as per SIS and CBT, guidelines steps by checking the harness connection’s and the resistance it’s was greater than 5000 ohms, the circuit it was in the spec. It was decided that we must replace the speed sensor even the circuit has correct ohms just to make sure. After install in a new speed sensor, machine did same thing as per operator complain before. The wheel loader don’t want to move backwards and forwards either, so artisan used  a bore scope camera in the torque convertor housing, through the hole of the torque convertor output speed sensor (318-1179), and found the gear (237-9059) missing from the shaft. Torque convertor and transmission was removed from machine and disassembled where artisan found the bolt part number 0S-1579  for the idler gear was lose and fail into lower part of torque convertor as well the gear part 237-9059.

CRM-1056418-M2C5,C7.1 Engines - DOC moved and CEM replacement,"In the last months, we have observed a recurrent issue with C7.1 Engines. We found that the DOC was moved towards the DPF, causing the soot antenna to bend. This antenna is located between the DOC and the DPF. 

We know about the publication M0077352, which indicates that the main cause of this failure is the incorrect specification of fuel used. However, in the five cases that we have studied, all the fuel samples analyzed were within specifications. 

In case of the customer that owns the 930M S/N KTG03093, we found the same issue some weeks later in another machine , so we think that in some moment, the customer used an incorrect fuel, so that the issue appeared in more than one machine. But, none of the samples confirmed us this fact. I attached a PSRT to check the Diagnostic Codes and some pictures of the antennae and blocked hole. 

For the 962M S/N F2T00332, we had high soot level on the machine. After doing some manual regenerations, we found the hole for the soot antennae was blocked (see attached pictures). Before replacing the CEM, the code E3387- 2 appeared, but after replacing the CEM, we had the diagnostic codes E3387- 2 and E995 (3) active. Then, we replaced the EGR valve and the problem was solved. We suspect that maybe the high soot level in the DPF caused by the malfunction of the EGR was blocking it, so that the DOC moved. Fuel samples were correct also in this case.

Regarding the 962M S/N F2T00332, only high sool level was reported from the machine. We found the DOC moved towards the DPF and fuel samples were also ok. No clue why it happened.

Finally, a year ago we found on the M320F S/N F2W374 that the soot antenna of the CEM was broken with similar symptoms. 

When these issues happened, we find difficulties to explain the customers why it happened. The only publication that we have about this indicates that the incorrect specification of fuel is the cause of this fault, but we have no way to demonstrate this if fuel samples were ok. We are wondering if the high soot load could cause the DOC to move. Also, if the malfunction of the EGR could cause this issue. Could be more root causes for the DOC to move?

The consequences of this issue are severe.. Not only for the cost of CEM replacement, but also because of the working hours that we have to spend diagnosing this issue, since the first thing that come to our mind is not the DOC movement (usually it is not the main cause of high soot load). Normally we have to replace first the Backpressure valve, the NRS valve and some sensors like the DPF inlet temperature sensor. And carry out many tests betweem them.

The cracking manifests on the lower third of the rod surface and traces the spiral weld.
Given sufficient hours, the cracks will cross-link and lead to delamination/spallation of the surface coating, which introduces 3rd party abrasives at the rod to bushing interface and damages the lower grease and wiper seals.

Continuing data capture for prototype pump performance in lower ambient temperatures. Testing possible changes to DEF thaw calibration to determine effect on prototype pumps.
Root Cause: 
1: The SM2.2 Classic pump is sensitive to debris in the DEF system. 
2: The SM2.2 Classic pump debris sensitivity increases with cooler temperatures of DEF. 
3: The SM2.2 Classic pumps' sensitivity to debris is exacerbated with the removal of the backflow connector with checkvalve.

They are having at least three units that are having issues. He was saying the seat suspensions are REALLY noise to the point guys are wearing hearing protection in the cab. I had a look at 4 of their machine S/N’s and there is no service letters or even TIB’s on any seat suspension issues. He was also saying they have to buy a complete suspension at 1200.00 to fix it and was hoping there was something Cat could do.

I looked at 4 of the 9 and didn’t see any documentation.  The machines are all running the 423-7201 Deluxe seat group.

If we start the machine before the ECM's boot we cannot tram the machine.

Hastings Deering fitter found that the Air Compressor butterfly controller was unreliable, not responding and out of calibration/ configuration.
After removing the butterfly controller, the controller moved around to where it could be recognised by the ECM and allowed the Hastings Deering fitter to start the machine and override the required functions to be able to tram the machine again.

Note; the machine was able to be started and trammed off the ship, this indicates that the air compressor butterfly controller was still in calibration/ configured at the time the machine was trammed off of the ship.

CRM-1101617-N4D7,740B & 740 / T4R & B1P / 304-5455 Tailgate bent,"We have this customer with two used 740 and two used 740B.  One year ago customer bought these 4 truck without tailgates and them we installed to all machines a new scissors tailgate arrangements 304-5455 following Special Instruction REHS1155 but now all the trucks have these tailgates bent. Please see attached file ""Tailgate 740 B1P & 740B T4R"".
We believe that the reason why the tailgate was bent is because when the truck transports rocks, during the unloading these rocks roll and hit the tailgate. Probably this problem would not have it if the door opened before or long enough before the loading material begins to come out the bottom of the tailgate when unloading the material. This causes the door to bend at the end.
Of course tailgate is not required for this application but this customer works in a clay quarry and sometimes has to carry rocks and sometimes has to carry clay and to avoid spills he needs the tailgate. These application changes can occur on the same day so it cannot be possible to remove and set continuously the tailgate.
The ""big problem"" is that this customer also have two old Komatsu HM350 with tailgate doing exactly the same work than our 740 and these HM350 are not suffering of tailgate bent. It can be because the Komatsu tailgate opens earlier than Caterpillar tailgate because the opening system of the Komatsu tailgate does not pull the cable diagonally as the caterpillar does. Or it may also be that Komatsu tailgate design is more robust. See attached file ""Komatsu tailpipe system"".
So now the customer ask if we can reinforce the tailgate or modify the opening system to open before.
The situation is to be in bad place with respect to Komatsu.

Gear hunting clutch degradation is caused by thermal events related to excessive gear shifting. As clutches degrade, a shortened component life may be experienced. Assurance Program still in effect.

10/10/2019 - See note below.

July 18, 2019: Priority Service Letter to update Transmission Software. Release Target: July/August 2019. The new clutch protection software will adjust the transmission shifting strategy to prevent excessive shifting and clutch heat build-up ultimately improving transmission service life. The operator will see the transmission limited icon more often. It might feel like the machine is not shifting or holding gear. This is expected and does not warrant a service visit. New Assurance Program available for AT models (745, 740EJ and 740GC) sold to end user between 1/1/2019 and 12/31/2019.

Revision to PS53803: Release Target: 3rd Qtr 2019. Service Letter termination date extended to July 31st 2022. Adding serial numbers built between initial PS53803 release (July 2018) and production implementation of Round 3 fixes:
Clutch 3, 4, 5 durability improvements
April 2019 production, 3T601971 - Up
New Clutch 3 Housing Assembly with improved cooling, 574-4495 – fix for CPI 409898 added. Reworking of existing housing to new part number is recommended prime path.
Revision does not include the external lube lines update. References to several part rework special instructions added to provide dealers with alternates to ordering new parts (objective is to reduce pressure on parts supply)

CX38 Proactive Repair

Limited Distribution Before/After Service Letter (PS4) is being developed
Target Release: 4th Qtr 2019
Targeting key customers (4X, FCS, Vista Sand, etc.)
Available only to units that have not completed PS53803
Parts allocation strategy: limit allocations to dealer rebuild/repair capacity
Parts ordering Instructions: Same process used to complete PS53803 (DOWN orders and DSN’s)

Parts Availability: Over the last month, all parts have become more readily available. There are a few parts that still remain on CPI freeze to protect inventory for DOWN machines. A DOWN order must be placed against parts on CPI freeze. CPRO and FDO orders can be placed on parts not on CPI freeze.

April 23, 2019: Continuing work with service letter. Lead time is 20+ days for parts. There are still 3 open CPIs, two of three will be implemented into production 2nd Quarter 2019.

CRM-883396-H8G5,MT4400AC SE4 front wheel bearing 529-9330 potential parts quality problem,"Dealership is investigating multiple front wheel bearing failures on MT4400AC trucks at one site.  The affected bearing part number is 529-9330 being the inner front wheel bearing cone.  There have been a total of 5 failures on 3 trucks to date, with the highest hours achieved 6,900 hours, lowest 1,800 hours.  3 left hand side bearings, 2 right hand side bearings.  All of the failures have been on machines where the front wheel group was rebuilt by the dealer, mid 2017.  There are no CPI's in dealer view for MT4400 front wheel bearings at time of submission.

Our review of the failures seen to date has identified one common aspect to all of the failures: all 5 of the failed bearings seen so far were manufactured by ""SNH"" in China.  We have reasonable confidence that there have not been significant errors with bearing installation [mounting errors, parts discrepancies, improper alignment, preload etc].  We have found no discrepancies with service or maintenance aspects: incorrect or insufficient lubrication, or evidence of excessive service temperature.  In regard to machine application, there are some minor discrepancies with bias loading to the LHS of the machine, and some minor overloads below the 10/10/20 limit.  While load can be a contributor to shortened bearing life or early bearing failures, other similar machines with similar application conditions and loading deviations have not had any issues. 

When a new SNH bearing was visually compared to a same Caterpillar part number bearing manufactured by Timken, the surface texture of the raceways appears superior [smoother] on the Timken bearing.  The dealer does not have surface texture measurement tooling that could quantify this visual observation comment without cutting the bearing for access.  Since the run of failures is at this point confined to the SNH bearings, the dealer suggests the SNH bearings warrant a met-lab investigation and a CPI project initiation if the dealer's findings are supported.  As the bearings removed from the machines are damaged by the removal process, and as there may be certain bearing features that are proprietary IP, the dealer suggests metrological and metallurgical evaluations on new bearings be conducted by Caterpillar to establish if there are manufacturing discrepancies that would reduce bearing service life in this application, and advise the dealership of the outcome.    

There are currently another 3 wheel groups on other machines currently generating metal as identified by dealer SOS and visual inspection of the magnetic plugs.  We are planning to remove and replace these affected wheel ends next week [week 24, 2018] at which time we can update this DPPM ticket with the outcome of these inspections and add affected units if applicable.

The dealer's failure analysis reports for the first 2 failures are attached to this ticket, one remaining FA being reviewed before attaching to this ticket.

CRM-614838-H7G6,793 Rotating Clutch Seal Failures.,"Some (not all) transmissions are failing to meet PCR target life of 18,000 hours due to the No.2 8E-3837 rotating clutch seals (vespel) wearing prematurely to the point of failure (leakage/bypass).  Low TC oil level is the first indicator of  leaking seals as the scavenge pump cannot return the oil  from the transmission housing back to the reservoir (TC housing) fast enough .  Continued operation with this fault leads to clutch failure due to slippage as clutch engagement pressure is reduced.

TBU have determined PV of the current application exceeds the 8E-3837 rotating seal's capacity. The proposed PCA  is increased clutch piston diameter to allow for reduction in oil pressure (thereby keeping PV within the seal's capacity) without impacting force acting on the clutch discs. 

Even with the proposed design change, the CPI  team will still be looking for ways to improve the life of the seal on the current design.

The 150-8355 uni-joint is a grease for life part with a published life of 12,000 hours. Most sites have been targeting 8,000 hours. Failures have been occurring at around the 6,000 hour mark. Some sites have now change their scheduling to change them out at 4,000 hours. With these numbers, the situation is no better than the days prior to the stiffener rod.

Majority of failures have been on the rear end of the drive shaft (transmission end).

Loss of lubrication leading to heat generation and brinelling are early indicators before symptoms of vibration become more obvious. On a number of occasions, operators failed to pick up or react to the symptoms early enough resulting in catastrophic failures. No transmission has ever survived a driveshaft separation without destroying the input transfer case and gears within.

A new CPI has been created to revisit this issue.  CPI 391677. Dealer view currently not enabled. Sites have been advised to monitor part temperature with temp stickers and re-lube at every 250 hours per TIBU6682.

CRM-672641-R9R5,793F Brake Cooling Tube Fractures  - Brake Overtemp.,"There is a history of some machines failing the 367-7901 brake cooling tube leading to brake overheat events. Pump resonance under certain RPM range leading to excitation of the tube has been identified as a potential root cause. Recent activities includes communicating to sites to check the settings in the brake ECM configuration to ensure that the “Engine Cooling Fan Configuration” matches the iron on the truck.

This configuration specifically relates to the additional retarding arrangement and not to be confused with extended life wheel groups. All trucks in WA with the exception of the 17 ex-Olympic dam units are equipped with standard retarding arrangement therefore for the majority, the setting for the “Engine Cooling Fan Configuration” should be set to “Standard Cooling” and not Additional Cooling.

This setting alters the speed of the pump meaning it can impact the life of the brake cooling tube if the iron doesn’t match by operating in the damaging rpm range. 

In comparing some of the problematic trucks to those that achieve fair tube lives, it was clear that this really does have an impact. The problematic trucks were found to have had this configuration set to “Additional Cooling” whereas the trucks not seeing this issue anywhere near the same extent were set correctly to ”Standard Cooling""

An intermittent drip coming from the weep hole is an acceptable amount of leakage. Intermittent dripping can start and stop throughout the life of the pump, and is a normal part of the operation of the pump.

Wetness or discoloration as a result of dried coolant around the weep hole, without the presence of a continuous drip or a constant stream, is typically another indication of intermittent dripping that is part of the normal operation of the pump.

If a continuous drip is found coming from the water pump weep hole when the engine is off, or a constant stream when the engine is running, replace the pump.

The PT and CT Transformers are heavy components, comprised of copper windings incased in high purity epoxy resin.

Since the current design has a high center of gravity ( tall rectangular shape ), this results in excessive flexing of the metal base plate, which with time, fails due to cracking - please refer to the attached images for reference.

If the failure of the base plate causes the transformer to tip over, this scenario often results in a secondary damage due to HV arc and HV Cable / Lug damage.

The purpose of this DPPM is to gather information regarding the number of shovels affected, identify potential underlying issues, and request Caterpillar for resolution, which in this case should involve application of a "" low profile "" instrument transformers.

There was no debris on the drain plugs. The oil was not black and didn’t smell burnt, but was diluted with large amounts of hydraulic oil due to the seal failure.


DSN to Serv – 
I found Dealer Enabled CPI 355017, but it says your unit has the new designed brake housing. Has any debris been noticed on the magnetic plug? Is the oil black or smell burnt? I also found CPI 270416, but it was closed prior to your unit being built.

The mesh style harness covering in this area does not hold up well to mud and washing. Eventually the covering disintegrates and leaves the wires exposed and the harness also has a tendency to  wear through on the sharp corner on the inside bottom corner of the fuel tank and short or it can short on the clips that it is tied to or run through. 

The 113 orange wire runs from the cab to all four corners of the truck as it feeds multiple sensors and components from the front to rear of the truck. Unfortunately it also feeds the Brake Pressure Sensor, the Service Brake Accumulator Pressure Sensor and the Secondary/Parking Brake Accumulator Pressure Sensor.

CRM-877376-S7T9,20R3543 cylinder head combustion face surface finish causing leaks and rework,"3500 engines, 20R3543 reman cylinder head combustion face surface finish 'as received' from Caterpillar causing combustion gas leakage/coolant pressurization.

The dealership engine CRC process a large number of 3500 series engines annually, principally to support mining customers in our territory.  The engine CRC have found a large percentage of reman 20R3543 cylinder heads  being received from Caterpillar require rectification rework by the dealer to improve the 'as received' surface finish and prevent combustion gas leakage when the engine is run.  For example, this month [May 2018] we sold 17 x  20R3543 heads.  15 of these were reworked.  Last month in April we sold 61 x 20R3543 heads .  Approx. 55 of these were reworked.

The 20R3543 cylinder head is used in multiple 3500 series engine models and applications, including electric power, industrial and marine.  We do not see the issue with the 10R8618 UTN head.

When the problem first became evident, the issue was usually detected when the engine was run for the first time on the dyno.  The dealership engine CRC routinely use spacer plates that have been fitted with a drilled passage and external pipe to facilitate detection of combustion gas leakage on individual cylinder heads to shorten troublehooting time.  When a unacceptable leak is found, the offending cylinder head has to be swapped out and reworked, which is a significant inconvenience when the engine has been placed in the dyno room.   Combustion gas leakage also degrades coolant ferrules. 

The dealership estimates we have reworked around 30 heads per month over the last 2+ years.  This is approximately 720 heads over 2 years.  We have estimated the rework cost [machining time and labour] to be $238.42 AUD per head  …. Total rework cost borne by the dealer is therefore around $ 171,662.40 AUD, or approximately $130,000 USD. It appears on initial investigation that the dealer has only claimed rework costs on 8 heads, totalling $1907.36 AUD.

Refer to attached associated SR's, and presentations attached to this ticket that provide more detail on our investigations into this problem.  We have captured parts label information and head serial numbers on some of the heads in the presentations to aid reman facility identification.  Some of the heads that leaked had surface finish measurements that were checked to be within the 3.2 micrometre specification for roughness average using a Mitutoyo Surftest tool fitted with a 2 mm stylus, however we are unsure of the method and tooling used by Caterpillar, and whether measurements taken with different tooling or measurement techniques can be readily correlated.

Note the 'affected unit count' on this ticket is listed as one, but there would be too many engine serial numbers to list.

In addition to replacing with like part, I would recommend getting some close up photos of the failure area to better understand the failure mode. Photos of the installation area near the lower valve would be helpful as well. If the tube appears to have failed due to overpressurization it may be worth checking the system pressures at the lower valve. 

I would like get a look at the photos to see if there is anything unusual in the failure area or installation of the tubes.

CRM-813119-N9R2,980M  KRS Quick coupler hoses are too short.,"TC Detail:
This is a continuing problem that was first brought up in CRM-706103-L0Y1 and was not resolved.  The 447-3926 lines group hangs up on the Dog bones when the coupler it tilted and racked back.
We are looking for a solution to this which in our opinion would require the 447-3926 lines group to be routed up each side of the coupler instead of up thru the middle as is current.
See attached ppt. for pictures.
Q) Do you have other Dealers that have installed this coupler on 980M's and it is working well?  If so please advise which Dealer so that we can contact or supply pictures of the install so that we can see if we are doing something wrong or what we can change.

From previous DSN:
The 447-6627 Quick coupler was installed on this machine and the installer states that the hoses from the boom to the coupler had to be made longer than what was specified in M0072670. As well the lock cylinder lines had to be lengthened. They are saying that at standard length the hoses catch on the lugging on the quick coupler.
Q) Have you seen this before or do you have any suggestions on how to resolve this issue?
Pictures are attached. 
I think the best thing would be to make hose factory length and get a video of this happening but thought I'd ask Cat first if there were problems with the factory lines.

Tech Detail: I have delivered two 980M wheel loaders to Peter Kiewit in the Fort St John area and they both are having issues with the quick coupler/3rd Valve hydraulic lines tearing off. (see pictures attached) Is there any way you could dig up the proper hose routing for both of these units? Our new equipment preparation technicians has to make the hoses long enough that they would not break once the bucket / forks were racked back but they are long enough that when traveling they are damaged on the ground.

This machine is seeing engine oil in the coolant but no coolant in the engine oil. Oil sample attached. There has been considerable troubleshooting trying to resolve this. (see information below and in notes)  We have come across M0089701 which describes our issue. This engine was a Reman engine 20R4097, serial number RGX01357 and was installed at 18159 hours. That would make about 1753 hours on this Reman engine.  It's build sheet indicates it has the 516-9693 liners installed. The problem being we have pressured up cooling system but it doesn't loose pressure and again we do not see coolant entering the engine oil. Engine does use approx. 2 liters of oil every 8 hours but this is not confirmed with an oil consumption document at this time.
The only other thing I can think of is possible transmission cooler issue but they have not gone there yet as there is no complaint of loss of transmission oil.

Media suggests contacting DSN. Do you have any further information that would assist us in confirming that root cause of oil in coolant is in fact cracked cylinder liners?

Wondering why PS45751 for the front harness does not include the LRC machines which have been experiencing the same problems.

I am wondering if reason not seeing as many field failures was because out NEP personnel in Kamloops were cleaning up and correcting and number of hose and harness rubbing issues at PDI. This would have been reported to Tom Dyrland and possible in PIQ.  Finning spends over 20 hrs per machine cleaning up hose routing and harness contact and rubbing points at PDI.

There was CPI 225370 and a Service Mag SEPD1415 released to address this issue, and the PCA exhaust closure plate went into production on SSP00670.

During the project the team opinion was that the exhaust closure plate falling off was not cause to replace the starter.

The function of the the exhaust closure plate is to prevent potential contamination of the exhaust side of the starter. However, we do not have data that would confirm contamination of the starter exhaust in case of missing exhaust closure plate. In most cases, customers don't even notice/report missing plate immediately after it is lost. 

Any debris or foreign particles that enter into exhaust side of the starter are blown away with the next start attempt without any damage to the starter. CAT has been in discussion with suppliers to use an exhaust deflector. The exhaust deflector option is used in all other applications and we think to extend it to trucks as well. CAT is collecting data on deflector usage in machine application. The supplier is running field test on several sites.

If the power window does not raise or lower when the rocker switch is actuated, follow the procedure below. 

1.	Check mini-fuse 113-8491.
2.	Replace both power window relays, 231-3930, with 3E-5239 relays and then check to see if power window functions properly. 
3.	If power window still isn't working, check function of rocker switch, 222-7892 and replace if necessary. 
4.	If it still does not function, remove the door trim panel and disconnect the regulator 292-6964 from the window and ensure the window is not binding by sliding it up and down in the channel. It should slide freely down from the top position.  Reconnect the regulator and check window operation. 
5.	Check for power at window motor when actuating the switch. 
6.	If this procedure still does not result in a functioning power window, replace the window regulator, 292-6964

CRM-766320-H3L9,233-9748 transmission friction disc.  Fatigue failure of friction material in various transmission applications,"The 233-9748 friction disc used in various transmission applications is failing by fatigue erosion of the friction material between the lubrication grooves.  Failures have been seen by the dealership in multiple machine transmission applications, primarily D11/992/993/994 product lines in mining applications.  Refer attached failure analysis report documenting a D11R friction disc failure in clutch #5, and associated SR's referenced in this ticket.  Prior to 2016 we did not see the level of failures that we are currently seeing, so a supplier quality issue is suspected by the dealership.

In the failures seen by the dealership, mating clutch plates show no signs of heat generation or slippage, and clutch pressures and control valves have been in specification, so there's no obvious cause for the failures.  The problem does not appear to be confined to any particular customer or site, machine model, machine application, oil brand, oil viscosity etc: the only common factor appears to be the friction disc itself.

Failures have typically occurred between 2000 hours and 8000 hours.  When a transmission for a 834 machine was disassembled for an unrelated issue, the 233-9748 friction disc was examined.  It was found that the friction material was easy to break off with a fingernail.  The problem is reported in some cases by customer complaint: either the transmission hesitation to engage the selected gear, or by adverse SOS reports indicating the presence of friction material.

A review of dealership part number totals in SIMSi does not clearly identify this problem, however service hours entered may be machine hours instead of component hours, and when transmissions reaching PCR are overhauled, the friction discs may be scrapped without their condition being assessed.  There have also been issues with transmission solenoids or unrelated component failures that may have masked the occurrence of this problem.  The Caterpillar response to DSN ticket CRM-571288-M8B4 [associated SR to this ticket] indicated that during 2015 some of the paper material used in the disc were at the lower band of the specification.  Associated SR CRM-454248-P6Z9 resolution indicated a similar conclusion regarding date codes of discs that may have been suspect.  However the dealership know that later dated discs are still seeing this problem, which is the reason for this DPPM submission.  There's no CPI's listed against this part number.

5/9/2018 - HT821 SSP01164, The 317-1091 bracket has been replaced 2 times once at 10,109 and at 14,080. Each time it has started to damage the turbo pedestal. I have attached both service reports. 

June 26 - Mine in Canada has also had failures.  This issue was ranked a 4 out of 7 on the LMT CPI list.

Aug 7 - No additional progress made.  Tier 4 solution might be adopted as a PCA.

Aug 21 - Tier 4 solution might not be cost effective for field retrofit.  CPI team will continue to look at bracket redesigns. 

8/31/2018 - SSP01161 has broken another 317-1091 bracket at 16,462. This time needed to also replace the damaged 318-4787 support. I attached photos of the 317-1091 bracket.

Jim to follow up if there have been any clamping changes on the 797 that could be implemented onto the 793F.

Jan 16 - New hose material being validation on the 797F.  Once used test hose is reviewed (9000 hours), team will be able to implement a solution on 793 & 797.

Feb 6 - Failed parts are in Reno and should be shipped back for SIB.  It is important to SIMS these failures, and use the specific group number in SIMSi.

March 13 - Bob to follow up with Jim.

Mar 27  - 9000 hoses from Chile looked good.  Team working on determining next steps.  

April 13 - Request to inspect the 4 trucks that had the hoses replaced.   Joe McCoy to follow up.  Jim to follow up on the FA of the hoses sent back. 

April 25 - According to the design engineer:  The 793 and 797 have the same hose material and clamp types.  So I am not surprised that they are leaking as well.   If we can get something to work better on the 797 we could implement on the other machines as well.  These look pretty good compared to other returns I've seen. They have minimal heat cracking on the ends and nothing on the rest of the hose.  Jim's Feedback on the CPI -  I honestly don’t think this CPI project will be active anytime soon.  We got a 797 field follow part returned and it looked good, but the design team decided that it wants more test samples before moving forward with the new supplier/material.

June 26 - When Cashman replaces the hoses, they are using new clamps.  After initial torque, the retorque spec is 7 nm (applies to T style clamps).

July 16 -2nd set of field follow hoses from 797 to be shipped to Cat from Chile.  There are no 793F test parts available or in test at this time.

Aug 7 - 797 parts going through stakeholder review.  If 797 does go into production, 793 could be replicated.

Aug 21 - 797 solution moving forward.

Root Cause 
Dirt packing in coupling removes all axial play of the coupling group and fixes the axial position of the coupling. When a new engine or adapter group is connected to a reused coupling group that has not been cleaned the difference in axial position can force the crankshaft into a position that preloads the thrust washer during operation and leads to rapid failure of the thrust washer.

ICA: SL PS45370 released for dealers to thoroughly clean the Coupling to ensure that all contamination debris is removed from metal components.

CRM-709380-L2K7,793F SSP body retaining cable failures.,"Body retaining cable failures,  part number 282-3658 on 793F machines.  The body retaining cables are the only prescribed method of holding the body in the raised position for service tasks.  The body needs to be raised and held securely to perform a number of service tasks, including machine frame inspections, or if the hoist cylinders or associated hydraulic systems are being serviced or replaced.  Although we believe the design for the cables provides adequate strength and conforms to [or exceeds] applicable safety compliance standards when new, insidious deterioration, wear & tear can reduce the break strength by an unknown amount - the cable condition cannot be reliably established by cursory visual inspection alone.  If there is a concurrent failure of the hoist system or unauthorised hoist operation due to failure of site tag-out/isolation procedures, the cables can break and allow the body to drop.  

The failures that have been reported to this dealership have been unexpected and sudden, and this has the potential to cause death or serious injury to maintenance personnel working under the raised body. The impact of a body drop onto the frame pads also has the potential to damage the machine frame.  There are likely to be other cable failures that the dealership are unaware of, as mine sites or individuals may be reluctant to report certain incidents if there are no consequences or witnesses.   

Another aspect to the issue is the use of the standard supplied cables with aftermarket bodies, or bodies containing wear packages which alter the load placed on the cable from the assumed load.

CRM-707183-D0V5,"785D, MSY, High fuel consumption than previous 785C series truck..","At the end of 2014 the customer started to realice that the fuel consumption on each of his 3 x 785D trucks  was higher than in each of the 12 x 785C series trucks he owns working in the same mine site. At that time he just asked for data (see CRM1080384-GRVP ticket).
Then he started to gather consumption data that showed that trend. At the middle of 2015 he complained with data on hand.
As a matter of clarity, please see the following facts:
- July 2015. The customer complained of a fuel consumption of around 6,5% higher in D-series compared against C-series.
- October 2015. CAT-FSA carried out a performance test on-site. Results were that D-series consumed around 9% more than C-series.
- January 2016. Supercomm2 were installed in two trucks (oine C and one D working side by side).
- February 2016. Customer meeting. CAT recognized a higher fuel consumption than expected and took the commitment of developing new flashes. 
- October 2016. New flash file was installed on one D-series truck and Supercomms2 were installed back.
- After some period of inactivity, the trucks came back to work. Data being sent by Supercoms2.
- January 2017. CAT released PELJ2118 “524-3072 field retrofit software for eligible markets”. 0 to 6% improvement in fuel efficiency on 785D.
- May 2017. The customer finished his new study and called for a meeting to show the results. His conclusión was that the real fuel consumption with the new software is 5 to 6% higher in D-series versus C-series. He asked for further improvement as CAT committed time ago.
In May 2017 the plan was to flash the other two remaining 785D trucks with the same flash file and test the performance to confirm or not the data got with the first truck. The fact is that in June 2017 (when all three 785D trucks had the same new flash file) the customer experienced a really high coal demand and then the  main concern was how to reach that production, so that the fuel consumption control was not the priority for some time. Now, Setp 2017, the coal demand has stabilized and the customer resumes the issue.
The plan is:
- Resume the confirmation about consumption from all three 785D trucks compared againts 785C.
- If data shows that the consumption is still higher, the customer is willing to allow FSA-CAT to carry out a performance site keeping in mind that we should respect his plans about production.

•	REHS8503 provide the basic instructions for modifying the 333-1195 pre-cleaner group.
•	The new tall screen assembly can be added to the existing pre-cleaner cap assembly

•	Looking at the pictures from Kearl the clearance between the ATAAC pipe and the pre-cleaner top after the screen installation is minimal, the extension pipe 421-2606 will need to be cut down &/or the short plenum may be required.

Upon questioning the site personnel, it was discovered that this is not the first event of such sort, and that the customer has resorted to installing Safety Chains, on the other MD6640 drill on site as a preventive measure.

Finning ( Canada ) was also advised that apparently another customer in the area experienced similar event.

Detailed information with respect to these events are being gathered at this point.

The described scenario may have potentially very serious consequences with respect to the following:
1) Safety of drill personnel
2) Equipment damage
3) Machine downtime and loss of production

It is the opinion of Finning ( Canada ) that immediate action should be taken by the Drill Product Group to prevent the above noted event.

CRM-1006000-F1F2,140K Air Cleaner Housing Melting,"The Air cleaner housing and Coolant tank meted from the heat of the exhaust muffler. This is the second failure the customer has experienced in 204 hours. The first failure occurred when the waste gate of the turbo was stuck in the closed position. At the time the root cause of the air cleaner melting was due to the turbo waste gate that was stuck in the closed position which caused the turbo to over boost and causing elevated exhaust temperatures. A new turbo, air cleaner housing and coolant tank was fitted. The machine went back to work and 204 hours later the air cleaner housing has melted again. See the attached report.
On the first failure a DSN CRM-955062-N1K9 was submitted. The reply came back: "" Please keep in mind that the DSN is for support on making repairs, not on investigating the specifics regarding component wear and failure. With that being said, I have passed along the information you have provided in your report to our CPI team for them to review and look into.

We removed the 491-7840 muffler and fitted the old 372-4991 muffler. A new air cleaner was also installed over the weekend. While we were waiting for an operator to test the machine we cut the 491-7840 muffler open. I could not see anything wrong with the muffler. The inlet and outlet of the muffler was open. I then knew we have not found the root cause of the air cleaner housing melting. The operator took the machine and went and worked with it. I was taken to the machine where it was working and I noticed that the engine was smoking black. I stopped the machine and took the surface temperature of the air cleaner housing. The temperature was 134°C and one could see that the housing showed signs of melting. I waited for the compartment to cool down. The operator told me that the machine had no power. After the compartment has cooled down I told the operator to work the machine and while he was working I could hear that the turbo was loosing boost pressure. The machine was taken back to the workshop and investigated. It was found that the 177-0581 hose at the after cooler was torn. See the attached report. A new hose was fitted and the machine was tested. the operator was smiling again because the machine had power. The surface temperature of the air cleaner housing was 87°C. In my opinion the exhaust temperature increased because of over fuelling. The engine did not receive the correct amount of air for the amount of fuel. Regards, Marius. 
From Chuck, Marius, thanks for the update, we believe the problem is with the muffler, If the machine runs good with the old muffler please cut one of the new ones open and check for restrictions
Charles, As I have mentioned in my failure report that PI32840 was applied to the machine in April 2018 and the same service letter was applied to 140K SZL01947 in May 2018 on the same site and both machine has the same symptoms. Because the site is so remotely and to get parts here. We found the old muffler and decided to fit the old muffler to the machine today and test the machine. Regards, Marius.
From Chuck LeMons, Marius, I would like you to check for any kind of exhaust leaks. Then go ahead and apply PI32840 in the event you do have a cracked tube. Also the service letter replaces the muffler. We have had and issues or two where we found the inside of the muffler broken. By applying the Service letter you will get a new muffler. I'm not going to ask for the muffler back but if your problem is corrected you have my permission to cut the muffler open and check for damage.
Charles, I forgot to mention that the ambient temperature now is around 37 - 42 degree c.
Charles, I went to the machine. The machine showed no overheating from the previous download I suspect that the 491-7840 muffler is restricted which cause the high engine compartment temperatures. Why I say this is the customer has another 140K SZL01947 which the service letter PI32840 was carried out on the same site with the same failure. See the attached failure report and PSR of the machine. Do you have any other suggestions? Regards, Marius.
From Chuck LeMons Tier II, Marius, Valerie passed this on to me after see asked for additional information. I will wait to hear back from you, I am trying to determine if this an engine issue or cooling installation. I need to understand it the waste gate is failing first and why.

Does Caterpillar have a new tank design or something that can make these machines run on a slope with half tank of fuel and not throw the E1239 code? 
****This is the root cause of these codes for CPI Number:  373550 ****
The fuel level in the tank and pick up location as it comes out of fuel at times on the slopes is the problem. The fuel gage in the tank also swings from full to empty at the same time.

The XQ400 (CG137) (AL5 & FYR) genset packages have had the exhaust blankets removed from around the inlet and outlet O2 sensors to prevent the sensors from overheating.
The exhaust piping that contains the outlet O2 sensors has also been rotated so the O2 sensor is at the side inside of at the top of the piping.
This has also resulted in the O2 sensors running cooler and lasting longer.
Reports of failed O2 sensors on the CG137 genset packages has dropped off considerably due to these changes.
